# BootstrapActivity
In this activity, I learned how to make different colors by changing the percentage of opacity,
and how to apply borders, I struggled in applying round border, it didn't work and then I found
out that I'm lacking of a code "border" in the class, so it's important to make sure that every
code needed are included completely.
In the display utilities, I was confused in the instruction, if the second image is only visible in
small screen or it should be the only image visible in small screen, and where the third image
should be visible, if it will disappear in medium screen, I decided to make it visible in large
screen, since the first image will disappear in large screen. Anyway, it's fun to do this activity...
